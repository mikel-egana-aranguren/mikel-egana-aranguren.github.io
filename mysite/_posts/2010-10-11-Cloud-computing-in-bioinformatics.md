A very interesting article on the topic by Lincoln D Stein: <a href="http://genomebiology.com/2010/11/5/207/comments">The case for cloud computing in genome informatics</a>. Related: <a href="http://www.few.vu.nl/~jui200/webpie.html">reasoning in the cloud</a>. I think it is a good idea to use "cloud reasoning" in order to reason over huge biomedical data/ontologies, since performance has been always a problem when it comes to biomedical reasoning!

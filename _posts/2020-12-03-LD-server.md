title: "New Linked Data server for teaching"

I have created a new [Linked Data](https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/data) server for teaching purposes, comprising:

* [Blazegraph](https://github.com/blazegraph/database) as Triple Store. 
* [Trifid](https://github.com/zazuko/trifid) as frontend for web browsing and content negotiation, i.e. "dereferencing".

It can be found at [GitHub](https://github.com/mikel-egana-aranguren/MSc-UM-2020-FAIR), including a [Zenodo DOI](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4302267).

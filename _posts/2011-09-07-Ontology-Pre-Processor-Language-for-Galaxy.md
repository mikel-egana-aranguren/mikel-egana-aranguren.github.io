title: "Ontology Pre Processor Language for Galaxy"
date: 2011-09-07

I have just released the first version of OPPL Galaxy, a wrapper of <a href="http://oppl2.sourceforge.net/">OPPL</a> for the <a href="http://galaxy.psu.edu/">Galaxy</a> platform. OPPL is an scripting language for manipulating ontologies; Galaxy is a platform for executing Bioinformatics workflows. Since ontologies are an important part of data analysis in Bioinformatics, it made sense to adapt OPPL to Galaxy. Plus it was really easy ;-)

You can find it in the <a href="http://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/">Galaxy Tool Shed</a>, under Ontology Manipulation.

OPPL Galaxy is built on top of <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/oppl2/files/OPPL%20API/">OPPL API</a>, <a href="http://owlapi.sourceforge.net/">OWL API</a> and <a href="http://clarkparsia.com/pellet">Pellet</a>. Thanks to all of them!

This is a competition in which the competing research groups are provided with a set of sequences for which function is unknown, and the group must predict the <a href="http://geneontology.org/">GO</a> term of the sequence. More information can be found at the <a href="http://biofunctionprediction.org/">AFP SIG</a> (<a href="http://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2011">ISMB 2011</a>).

Very interesting article by <a href="http://www.biochemj.org/bj/424/bj4240317.htm">Attwood et al</a>, relevant to <a href="http://ontogenesis.knowledgeblog.org/">Ontogenesis Knowledge Blog</a>.
<p style="padding-left:30px;">“It is quite depressive to
think that we are spending millions in grants for people to perform
experiments, produce new knowledge, hide this knowledge in a
often badly written text and then spend some more millions trying
to second guess what the authors really did and found”</p>

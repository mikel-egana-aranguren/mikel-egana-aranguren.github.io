I have just finnished reading the book "The Data-Centric Revolution: Restoring Sanity to Enterprise Information" by Dave McComb from [Semantic Arts](https://www.semanticarts.com/).

This book is on the spot, describing why less code and more data (in the form of Knowledge Graphs) is one of the best strategies for sustainable enterprise architectures that break current data silos.

That is also the idea behind the developments I worked on while at [Eccenca GmbH](https://eccenca.com/), also one of the signatories of the [Data Centric Manifesto](http://www.datacentricmanifesto.org/).

The other book by McComb, "Software wasteland", describes another face of the same problem. This interview is a good summary: [Are you spending way too much on Software?](https://www.strategy-business.com/article/Are-You-Spending-Way-Too-Much-on-Software?gko=88503).

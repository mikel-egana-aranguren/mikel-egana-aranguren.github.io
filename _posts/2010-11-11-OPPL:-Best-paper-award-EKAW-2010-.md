title: "OPPL: Best paper award EKAW 2010 "

I'm glad my former colleagues have obtained the best paper award in <a href="http://ekaw2010.inesc-id.pt/awards.html">EKAW 2010</a> with the paper "<a href="http://miuras.inf.um.es/~mfoppl/">Enriching the Gene Ontology via the Dissection of Labels using the Ontology Pre-Processor Language</a>". I was invited to participate in the paper but I decided that finishing my PhD was more important, so I kind of regret it nowÂ  :-)

In any case, I'm really happy about OPPL, an scripting language I "invented" to work with OWL ontologies during my PhD, since it is very rare for PhD prototypes to go on into "production" or to be continued by others. OPPL improves thanks to Luigi Iannone, who maintains <a href="http://oppl2.sourceforge.net/">OPPL 2</a>, and I have been told that the user base is steadily growing, so I can't ask for more!

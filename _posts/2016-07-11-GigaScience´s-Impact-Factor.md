Even though the editors of GigaScience <a href="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/gigablog/2016/07/08/jif_problems/">don't like Impact Factors</a> (and I agree with them), GigaScience has received a very high Impact Factor, 7.46. I'm quite happy since we published a paper in GigaScience last year, <a href="http://gigascience.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13742-015-0092-3">Enhanced reproducibility of SADI web service workflows with Galaxy and Docker</a>.

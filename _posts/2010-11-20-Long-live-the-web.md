Excellent <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=long-live-the-web">article by TBL</a>. I like the whole thing, and specially this bit:
<p style="padding-left:30px;">A great example of future promise, which leverages the strengths of all the principles, is <a href="http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkedData.html">linked data</a>.  Today’s Web is quite effective at helping people publish and discover  documents, but our computer programs cannot read or manipulate the  actual data within those documents. As this problem is solved, the Web  will become much more useful, because data about nearly every aspect of  our lives are being created at an astonishing rate. Locked within all  these data is knowledge about how to cure diseases, foster business  value and govern our world more effectively.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Scientists are actually at the forefront of some of the largest  efforts to put linked data on the Web. Researchers, for example, are  realizing that in many cases no single lab or online data repository is  sufficient to discover new drugs. The information necessary to  understand the complex interactions between diseases, biological  processes in the human body, and the vast array of chemical agents is  spread across the world in a myriad of databases, spreadsheets and  documents.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">One success relates to drug discovery to combat <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/13/health/research/13alzheimer.html">Alzheimer’s disease</a>.  A number of corporate and government research labs dropped their usual  refusal to open their data and created the Alzheimer’s Disease  Neuroimaging Initiative. They posted a massive amount of patient  information and brain scans as linked data, which they have dipped into  many times to advance their research. In a demonstration I witnessed, a  scientist asked the question, “What proteins are involved in signal  transduction and are related to pyramidal neurons?” When put into  Google, the question got 233,000 hits—and not one single answer. Put  into the linked databases world, however, it returned a small number of  specific proteins that have those properties.</p>
